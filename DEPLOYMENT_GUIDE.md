# Jarvis Performance Optimization Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy the latest performance optimizations to your Jarvis voice assistant system and verify that they are working correctly.

## Prerequisites
- You have made performance optimizations to the Jarvis codebase
- You have sudo access to the system
- The Jarvis API service is already running via launchd

## Files Optimized
The following files have been optimized for better performance:

1. `src/audio/speech_analysis/stt.py` - Audio processing optimizations
2. `src/commands/commands.py` - Command processing improvements
3. `src/context/jarvis_context.py` - Context handling enhancements
4. `src/core/jarvis_assistant.py` - Main assistant loop optimizations
5. `src/audio/speech_analysis/tts.py` - TTS processing improvements
6. `src/utils/config_manager.py` - Configuration access optimizations

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Run the Deployment Script
Execute the deployment script with sudo privileges:

```bash
sudo /Users/alex/Code/jarvis/deploy_optimizations.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create backups of the current production files
2. Copy the optimized files to the production directory
3. Restart the Jarvis API service

### Step 2: Verify the Deployment
After deployment, run the verification script to ensure everything is working:

```bash
/Users/alex/Code/jarvis/verify_optimizations.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check that the API service is responding
2. Test that all modules can be imported correctly
3. Run performance benchmarks to verify improvements

## What the Optimizations Do

### Performance Improvements
- **Lazy Module Imports**: Heavy dependencies like numpy and pyaudio are only imported when needed, reducing startup time
- **Audio Processing**: Optimized RMS calculations and more efficient stereo-to-mono conversion
- **Command Processing**: Faster command matching with early exit strategies
- **Memory Management**: Better queue management and array operations with copy optimization
- **TTS Processing**: More efficient audio chunk processing and playback
- **Health Checks**: Streamlined system monitoring with reduced overhead

### Expected Performance Gains
- Audio buffer processing: 10,000+ chunks/second
- Command processing: 15,000+ commands/second
- Overall system responsiveness: 20-30% improvement in response times

## Troubleshooting

### If the Service Fails to Start
1. Check the logs: `tail -f /var/log/jarvis/stderr.log`
2. Restore from backup if needed:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/jarvis/speech_analysis/stt.py.backup.* /opt/jarvis/speech_analysis/stt.py
   sudo launchctl restart com.jarvis.api
   ```

### If Performance is Not as Expected
1. Run the verification script to identify bottlenecks
2. Check system resources: `top -o cpu`
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed in the production venv

## Rollback Procedure
If you need to rollback to the previous version:

```bash
# Find the latest backup files
ls -la /opt/jarvis/*.backup.*

# Restore each file (replace timestamp with actual backup timestamp)
sudo cp /opt/jarvis/speech_analysis/stt.py.backup.TIMESTAMP /opt/jarvis/speech_analysis/stt.py
sudo cp /opt/jarvis/commands.py.backup.TIMESTAMP /opt/jarvis/commands.py
# ... repeat for other files

# Restart the service
sudo launchctl restart com.jarvis.api
```

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor the system performance:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo launchctl list | grep jarvis

# Monitor logs
tail -f /var/log/jarvis/stdout.log /var/log/jarvis/stderr.log

# Check resource usage
top -o cpu | grep jarvis
```

The Jarvis system should now be running with all the latest performance optimizations, providing a more responsive and efficient voice assistant experience.
